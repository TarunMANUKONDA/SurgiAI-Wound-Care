• Minimal to no drainage
• Itching (sign of healing!)
• Sutures ready for removal

✅ **Weeks 3-6 (Maturation):**
• Scar forming
• Color changes from red to pink to white

**📅 General Healing Phases:**

**Phase 1: Hemostasis (0-24 hours)**
• Blood clotting
• Bleeding stops
• Scab begins forming

**Phase 2: Inflammatory (Days 1-5)**
• Redness and swelling
• White blood cells fighting bacteria
• May have mild drainage

**Phase 3: Proliferative (Days 5-21)**
• New tissue forming
• Wound contracts/closes
• New blood vessels growing
• Itching common

**Phase 4: Maturation (3 weeks - 2 years)**
• Scar forms and matures
• Tissue strengthens
• Color fades over time

**📍 Healing Time by Wound Type:**
• Simple incision: 2-3 weeks
• Abdominal surgery: 4-6 weeks
• Joint surgery: 6-8 weeks
• Skin graft: 2-4 weeks to attach
• Deep wounds: 6-8+ weeks

**Factors That Affect Healing:**
• ✅ Good nutrition (speeds healing)
• ✅ Young age
• ✅ Good blood supply
• ❌ Diabetes (slows healing)
• ❌ Smoking
• ❌ Poor nutrition
• ❌ Infection
• ❌ Certain medications
